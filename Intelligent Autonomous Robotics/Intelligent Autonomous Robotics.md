## History of Robotics

> **Robotics** is a branch of technology that deals with physical robots.

Robots are programmable machines that are usually able to carry out a series of actions autonomously, or semi autonomously.

Got their name from the Czech word for slave **robota**.



**Three Laws of Robotics**

> **A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.**

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.



The first commercial robot in 1961: **the Unimate.**

**It could:** 

- open a bottle of beer and pours it.
- put a golf ball into the hole.

## Modern Robots

> **Autonomous** Robots make decisions in response to their environment not preprogrammed.

> **Roboticist** is responsible for the design, programming, construction, and testing of robots.

## Challenges of Autonomous Manipulation

- Grasping
- Holding
- Moving

## Locomotion and Manipulation

> **Autonomous robots** are systems that sense, actuate, compute, and communicate.

> **Sense** is the perception of the surrounding environment.

> **Actuate** is the motion of the robot itself and/or manipulation of surrounding objects.

> **locomotion** is the ability of the robot to move.
>
> during locomotion the robot uses its motors to exert forces on its environment to move itself.

> **manipulation** is the ability to move objects in the environment of the robot.
>
> during manipulation robot uses motors to exert forces on objects to move them relative to the environment.

Locomotion includes different concepts of motion such as rolling, Walking, running, jumping, sliding, crawling, climbing, swimming, and flying.

> The way in which the individual parts of a robot can move with respect to each other and the environment is called the **kinematics** of the robot.

Kinematics are only concerned with the position and speed but not its dynamics, which include acceleration.

## Actuators

> An **actuator** actuates or moves something. An **actuator** uses some type of energy to provide motion or to apply a force.

## Static and Dynamic Stability

> A **statically stable** mechanism will not fall even when all of its joints freeze

> A **dynamically stable** robot instead requires constant motion to prevent it from falling.

## Degrees of Freedom

**DOF** is important for defining the possible positions and orientations a robot can reach.
